# Drum-Machine
A drum machine in the making. As of right now, it can do two things:  
1. Allow you to play the hihat, snare, and bass drum using the left, right, and down keys respectively. To play the beat back, you can press the up key and it will play at the same tempo as you made the bet with, making what you played and what you hear identical to each other.  
2. Allows you to visually see what you just played, almost as if there is interactive sheet music in front of you.  
To-Do List:    
1. Allow the visual sheet music to "wrap around" and go on forever, not until the end of the screen.  
2. Add more drums to play.  
3. Allow for specific user key bindings.  
4. Much more -- overall user interface enhancements.
